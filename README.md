# Readable Project

This is the second project in Udacity's React nano-degree. It's built using
React, Redux and React Router. It's a content managment system where users can
add, edit, vote and remove posts & comments.

[**Demo Link**](https://readable-client.now.sh) (Note: Usually it takes a while to load the app for the first time because the hosting service freezes the app if there is no traffic driven to it).

## Architecture and deployment

* The application is a SPA that connects to API server to retreive data.
* API server is deployed using `Now` too and data is saved in memory.
